#Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

width = 17
height = 12.0

# For each of the following expressions, write the
# value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

print(width//2)
# Answer = 8

print(width/2.0)
# Answer = 8.5

print(height/3)
# Answer = 4.0

print(1 + 2 \* 5)
# Error
